My macro and spreadsheets for keeping track of nutrition information

Please take note that the food info sheet is not completed and can be updated for personal eating habits. All daily values percentages referenced on here are based on Canadian nutrition values and are not guaranteed to be completely accurate.

These sheets are designed for personal use only. To use the sheets paste into a blank Visual Basic file, which can be accessed by performing the following:
--> Developer tab
--> Visual Basic under Code

I recommend creating the files by going to the VBAProject Manager on the side and perfomring the following:
--> VBAProject (PERSONAL.XLSB)
--> Right click Modules
--> Insert
--> Module

The macros can be run by performing the following:
--> Developer
--> Macros under code
--> Click "PERSONAL.XLSB!populate_Nutrition_Information
--> Click "Run"
--> Select range of cells to be filled
--> Select the Food_Info.xlsm sheet
